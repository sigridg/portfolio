### Monitoring the Norwegian Innovation System through the Corona pandemic (2020)
Role: Project leader
During the corona crisis, the Norwegian government has initiated several extraordinary measures to increase activity in Norwegian business and industry, prevent unnecessary closures and to get as many people as possible into work. Several actors in apparatus for innovation and development of business and industry, have been given additional tasks and new extraordinary measures have been established. To be able to monitor the use of the measures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has commissioned Innovation Norway to establish a dataset that include regularly updated data on how the measures affect the business community. I was the project leader of this work which resulted in a visualisation of the data made in PowerBI and  published on the [webpage of the Norwegian Goverment](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/naringsliv/sporsmal-og-svar-for-norske-bedrifter-om-koronautbruddet/koronadata/id2740151/) and dataset that covers schemes from 13 different actors in the Norwegian Innovation system. The raw data is avilable on [GitHub](https://github.com/innovationnorway/analysis-innovation-policy-data)

### Effect indicators for Innovation Norway Corpororate Governance system (2015)
Role: Project leader
In 2014 Innovation Norway got new goals and an expectation from the owners (the ministry of trade and fisheries) that the governance system should include indicators that measure the impact of Innovation Norway support on economic performance. With the research departement of Statistics Norway we developed KPIs intended for repeated use in the process of goal setting and
decision making. The method estimates average treatment effects of participation in the IN-programs based on a matched
Differnce In Difference approach (see [publication that describes the method](https://www.ssb.no/virksomheter-foretak-og-regnskap/artikler-og-publikasjoner/_attachment/237374?_ts=14f4b02a260) for more details.
The KPIs are used as part of the yearly report and evalutation of perfomance in dialogue with the Ministry.
