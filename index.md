### Green reporting in the Norwegian Innovation System (2021)
Role: project leader

On assignment from the  Ministry of Trade and Fisheries I am the project leader for developing joint indicators for projects with climate and environment effect within the Norwegian Innovation System. The project is a collaboration of the Research Council, SIVA, ENOVA and Innovation Norway.


### Monitoring the Norwegian Innovation System through the Corona pandemic (2020)
Role: Project leader

During the corona crisis, the Norwegian government has initiated several extraordinary measures to increase activity in Norwegian business and industry, prevent unnecessary closures and to get as many people as possible into work. Several actors in apparatus for innovation and development of business and industry, have been given additional tasks and new extraordinary measures have been established. To be able to monitor the use of the measures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has commissioned Innovation Norway to establish a dataset that include regularly updated data on how the measures affect the business community. I was the project leader of this work which resulted in a visualisation of the data made in PowerBI and  published on the [webpage of the Norwegian Goverment](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/naringsliv/sporsmal-og-svar-for-norske-bedrifter-om-koronautbruddet/koronadata/id2740151/) and dataset that covers schemes from 13 different actors in the Norwegian Innovation system. The raw data is avilable on [GitHub](https://github.com/innovationnorway/analysis-innovation-policy-data)

### Innovation Norway scheme predictor (2020) 
Role: Project leader/architect

ML algoritme that predicts relevant from the 40ish schemes that Innovation Norway offers to Norwegian companies. The algorithm uses information from the VAT number of the company and a short text that describes the innovation project. The algorithm is used in a Microsoft PowerApp and integrated in Dynamics 365.

### Digitalisation of ESA state aid guidelines (2019)
Role: Project leader

All support from Innovation Norway to Norwegian companies have to be complient with [ESA state aid guidelines](https://www.eftasurv.int/state-aid/state-aid-guidelines). To ensure complience to the guidelines, Innovation Norway has several long word documents that all advisers need to use and understand. We wanted to digitalise this information for two reasons (1) to make it more availble for advisers and (2 )to prepare for automated processes and ML descicion support going forward. The information was converted to a sharepointlist with an information model that enabled connecting the information to other information about the schemes. From the list we created a Sharepointsite as frontend from the adivsers and a descicion loop for updating the information with flow and Teams. 
 

### Design and implementation of evalutation of sustainability in the project review process at Innovation Norway – 2015 
Role: Project leader/architect

Utvikling av og implementering av verktøy for vurdering av miljø- og samfunnseffekt i alle finansieringsprosjekter 

### Effect indicators for Innovation Norway Corpororate Governance system (2015)
Role: Project leader

In 2014 Innovation Norway got new goals and an expectation from the owners (the Ministry of Trade and Fisheries) that the governance system should include indicators that measure the impact of Innovation Norway support on economic performance. With the research departement of Statistics Norway we developed KPIs intended for repeated use in the process of goal setting and
decision making. The method estimates average treatment effects of participation in the IN-programs based on a matched
Difference In Difference approach (see [publication that describes the method](https://www.ssb.no/virksomheter-foretak-og-regnskap/artikler-og-publikasjoner/_attachment/237374?_ts=14f4b02a260) for more details).
The KPIs are used as part of the yearly report and evalutation of perfomance in dialogue with the Ministry.

### Reducing volume and increasing quality of the yearly report
As responible for the yearly reporting at Innovation Norway I had a personal mission to reduce the volume and increase the quality. When I started, the collection of yearly reporting to the ministries was around 750 pages. Included in this was verbose descriptions of services and activities that did not contribute to the governance prosess. Within three years we managed to reduce the volume to 250 pages and recievied feedback from the Ministries in the formal governance meeting that they perceived increased quality.
