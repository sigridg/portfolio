## Innovation Policy Data
During the corona crisis, the Norwegian government has initiated several extraordinary measures to increase activity in Norwegian business and industry, prevent unnecessary closures and to get as many people as possible into work. Several actors in apparatus for innovation and development of business and industry, have been given additional tasks and new extraordinary measures have been established, such as the compensation scheme through the Tax Administration.

To be able to monitor the use of the measures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has commissioned Innovation Norway to expand its reporting to include regularly updated data on how the measures affect the business community. Innovation Norway has, with the assistance of Economics Norway (Samfunns√∏konomisk Analyse AS), also obtained information on schemes other than its own to get a more complete picture of the use of measures.

The dataset that has been collected so far is included in this repository. A visualisation of the data made in PowerBI is published on the [webpage of the Norwegian Goverment](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/naringsliv/sporsmal-og-svar-for-norske-bedrifter-om-koronautbruddet/koronadata/id2740151/)
